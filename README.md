Magisk Quad9 DNS
==========
<a href="https://ibb.co/3sYjVhK"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/JdFG8kZ/DnsLeak.jpg" alt="DnsLeak" border="0"></a><br><br>
This module makes your device to use Quad9's DNS servers instead of the provided by the ISP:
* 9.9.9.9
* 149.112.112.112


It is not guaranteed to work on cellular networks on all devices. Some users/testers say yes, others say that it doesn't.
On Wi-Fi it always works though.

If you know how to make it always work on cellular networks and want to contribute, please do!
